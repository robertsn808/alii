# Alii Fish Market POS - Development Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for the Alii Fish Market Point of Sale (POS) and business management system. The goal is to create a modern, cost-effective solution that replaces the existing Toast POS system, providing a comprehensive suite of tools for online and in-person ordering, kitchen management, payment processing, and business administration.

## Core Components

The system will be built by integrating three key components:

1.  **`alii`**: The core application for Alii Fish Market. It will provide the customer-facing website, the staff POS interface, and the main backend logic for order management and business operations.
2.  **`UPP` (Universal Payment Protocol)**: This system will handle all non-cash payment processing. Its flexibility and lower transaction fees will provide a significant advantage over traditional POS payment systems.
3.  **`MCP` (AI Agent Stack)**: The AI agent stack will be integrated into a new admin portal. It will provide powerful tools for business insights, task automation, and financial management, helping the Alii Fish Market team streamline their operations.

## Development Phases

The project will be developed in the following phases to ensure a structured and incremental delivery:

### Phase 1: The Look and Feel

The first step is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly frontend. This phase will focus on replicating the design and user experience of the current `aliifishmarket.com` website to ensure brand consistency and a seamless transition for customers.

### Phase 2: Core Ordering System

Once the frontend is in place, I will implement the core online ordering system. This includes:
- Building out the online menu.
- Creating a shopping cart and checkout process.
- Integrating the `UPP` system for secure payment processing.

### Phase 3: Staff POS & In-Person Orders

Next, I will develop the staff-facing Point of Sale interface as a Progressive Web App (PWA). This will allow staff to:
- Take in-person orders using any tablet or smartphone.
- Process payments using the `UPP` system.
- Manage orders efficiently from the restaurant floor.

### Phase 4: Admin Portal & AI Integration

With the core POS functionality complete, I will build the administrative portal. This is where the `MCP` AI agents will be integrated to provide:
- Real-time business analytics.
- Automated marketing content generation.
- Tools for managing inventory and customer relationships.

### Phase 5: Kitchen & Financials

The final phase will focus on back-of-house and financial operations:
- Implementing a kitchen ticket printing system to streamline order fulfillment.
- Developing financial reporting features to simplify accounting and tax preparation.

This phased approach will allow for continuous feedback and ensure that each component of the system is robust and well-tested before moving on to the next.
